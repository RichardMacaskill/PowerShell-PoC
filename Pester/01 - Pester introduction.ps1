    ## Now lets make it fail
    <#
        Get-Service MSSQLSERVER | Stop-Service -force
    #>

    ## why do the two match tests pass?

    ## Its because of the SMO object you created in the test

     $srv = New-Object Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.Smo.Server AStupidNameThatDoesntexist

     $srv.Name -match '.exist'

    ## Sideways tip, always validate your SMO Server objects for failed connections
    ## I use the version property

    $srv.ConnectionContext.ConnectTimeout = 1 # so we dont have to wait


    foreach $srv in servers

    if($null -eq $srv.version)
    {
        Write-Warning "Uh-Oh The Beard is sad. Can't connect to $($srv.Name)"
        continue
    }
